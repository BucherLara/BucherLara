# Hello, nice to see you on my page!

I'm a 26 year old socialworker based in hamburg who recently started to learn programming @neuefische[neuefische website](https://www.neuefische.de/?utm_source=sea_google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=brand_neue_fische_bundesweit&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg72YpJSh-gIV2o9oCR0TJwTmEAAYASAAEgKK9vD_BwE)
I really enjoyed working as a socialworker but I'm absolutely excited about learning new things, such as programming.

I would love to combine my knowledge about **social issues** with my new learned **programming skills**.
